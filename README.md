# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Overview
Roza has created an interactive website for her belly button biodiversity project. The company, Improbable Beef, has asked Roza to study belly button bacteria to fina a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef. 

## Results
The page Roza has created has the following interactive elements:
- The test subjects can select their test id and view the following:
	- The top 10 bacteria cultures found in a horizontal bar chart
	- The bacteria cultures by sample in a bubble chart
	- The frequency of belly button washing per week in a gauge chart
	- The participants demographic information
	
## Summary
Each time the participant ID is changed, all graphics update to the information matching the ID. The web page is also mobile responsive and can be viewed on a variety of mobile devices. The website can be viewed at https://debcuyler.github.io/bellybutton/
